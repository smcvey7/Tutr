# Phase 3 Project
This project is intended to demonstrate the skills I have gained during phase 3 at Flatiron. The project comprises a single page application designed using ActiveRecord and React. The purpose of the application is for tutors and students to manage lesson appointments. Its main components are:

-A back-end built with Ruby, Sinatra, and SQLite3

-A front-end built with React where users can interact with the API to create, retrieve, modify, or delete lesson info.

-Within the app, users can log in and search existing users by either username or lesson topic. They can then view and modify users' existing lesson appoints or create new ones.

## Running

 From /phase-3-sinatra-react-project-backend first run `bundle install`, then start the server using the command `bundle exec rake server`. This will launch the server with the site accessible from [localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292/)

Then from /phase-3-sinatra-react-project-frontend run `npm install`. The application can then be opened using the command `npm start`.

---IMPORTANT---
Users are required to log in to access most of the functionality of the app. To do so use:
  username: teststudent
  password: password


# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
